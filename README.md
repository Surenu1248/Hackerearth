# Problem 1:
Chandu's girlfriend loves arrays that are sorted in non-increasing order. Today is her birthday. Chandu wants to give her some sorted arrays on her birthday. But the shop has only unsorted arrays. So, Chandu bought T unsorted arrays and is trying to sort them. But, he doesn't have much time to sort the arrays manually as he is getting late for the birthday party. So, he asked you to write a program to sort the T arrays in non-increasing order. Help him, or his girlfriend will kill him.

Input:
First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the size of the array.
Second line contains N space separated integers, denoting the array elements Ai.

Output:
For each test case, print the sorted array in non-increasing order.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= Ai <= 109

# Problem 2:
Ashu is very fond of Prime numbers and he like challenging his friends by giving them various problems based on Mathematics and Prime number. One of his friend Harshit is jealous and challenges him to solve a task. Task is :
Given a prime number X, you need to give the count of all numbers in range 1 to 106 inclusive which have minimum prime factor X.
Help Ashu in solving this task.

Input:
First line consist of numer of test cases T.
Each test case contains a single number X.

Output:
Output for each test case count of all numbers in range 1 to 106 inclusive which have minimum prime factor X.

# Problem 3:
You live in a village. The village can be represented as a line that contains n grids. Each grid can be denoted as a house that is marked as  or a blank space that is marked as H. A person lives in each house. A person can move to a grid if it is adjacent to that person. Therefore, the grid must be present on the left and right side of that person.

Now, you are required to put some fences that can be marked as B on some blank spaces so that the village can be divided into several pieces. A person cannot walk past a fence but can walk through a house. 

You are required to divide the house based on the following rules:

A person cannot reach a house that does not belong to that specific person.
The number of grids each person can reach is the same and it includes the grid in which the house is situated.
In order to show that you are enthusiastic and if there are many answers, then you are required to print the one where most fences are placed.
Your task is to decide whether there is a possible solution. Print the possible solution.

Input format

First line: An integer n that represents the number of grids ()
Second line: n characters that indicate the villages that are represented as H or .  
Output format

The output must be printed in the following format:

First line: If possible, then print YES. Otherwise, print NO.
Second line: If the answer is YES, then print the way to do so.
